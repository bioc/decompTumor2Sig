  o added URL for BugReports
+ Changed from manual NAMESPACE and *Rd files to a creation by roxygen2
+ Changed function names for reading data from "load..." to "read..."
+ Shortened the longest function names
  o getGenomesFromMutationFeatureData -> getGenomesFromMutFeatData
  o getSignatureListFromEstimatedParameters -> getSignaturesFromEstParam
+ Used robust sequence creation with seq, seq_len, seq_along instead of 1:N etc
+ Used native class checking such as is.numeric() instead of class()==...
+ Implemented wrapper functions for external classes which do not provide
  the necessary accessor functions

Changes in version 1.3.2 (2018-08-29)

  sets had the same size.
+ Added functions to verify the format of signatures, genomes and exposures:
  o isAlexandrovSet(), isShiraishiSet(), isSignatureSet()
  o sameSignatureFormat()
  o isExposureSet()
