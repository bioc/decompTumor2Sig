Description: Uses quadratic programming for signature refitting, i.e., to
    decompose the mutation catalog from an individual tumor sample into a set of
    given mutational signatures (either Alexandrov-model signatures or
    Shiraishi-model signatures), computing weights that reflect the
    contributions of the signatures to the mutation load of the tumor.
