Changes in version 1.3.0 (2018-07-26)
+ Submitted to Bioconductor

Changes in version 1.3.1 (2018-08-15)
+ Updated DESCRIPTION file
  o replaced Author and Maintainer by Authors@R
  o added URL for BugReports
+ Changed from manual NAMESPACE and *Rd files to a creation by roxygen2
+ Changed function names for reading data from "load..." to "read..."
+ Shortened the longest function names
  o getGenomesFromMutationFeatureData -> getGenomesFromMutFeatData
  o getSignatureListFromEstimatedParameters -> getSignaturesFromEstParam
+ Used robust sequence creation with seq, seq_len, seq_along instead of 1:N etc
+ Consistent use of native class checking such as is.numeric()
+ Implemented wrapper functions for external classes which do not provide
  the necessary accessor functions
+ Replaced instances of sapply() and unlist(lapply()) by vapply()
+ Updated vignette and made most code chunks runnable
+ Added greedy search option to plotExplainedVariance (significant speed-up)

Changes in version 1.3.2 (2018-08-29)
+ Fixed a minor bug in mapSignatureSets() that occurred when the two signature
  sets had the same size.
+ Added functions to verify the format of signatures, genomes and exposures:
  o isAlexandrovSet(), isShiraishiSet(), isSignatureSet()
  o sameSignatureFormat()
  o isExposureSet()
+ Moved description of deprecated BiocInstaller in vignette to BiocManager.

Changes in version 1.3.3 (2018-09-24)
+ Implemented own signature plotting to remove code dependency from pmsignature
+ Decoupled the following data conversions functions from pmsignature code:
  o getGenomesFromMutFeatData()
  o getSignaturesFromEstParam()
+ Moved some common code to a new internal function for ease of maintenance.
+ Fixed bugs:
  o Error when some sequence names where not found in the reference genome,
    e.g., due to different names of decoy sequences.
  o Minor problems with unlikely signatures composed of only the mutated base
    (no flanking bases)

Changes in version 1.3.6 (2018-10-29)
+ When transcription direction is taken into account: exclude mutations in
  regions with overlapping genes of opposing transcription directions by
  default! Previous versions of decompTumor2Sig took the approach of
  pmsignature, using the transcription direction of the first gene encountered
  in the transcript database (which is rather arbitrary); excluding these
  mutations appears more appropriate. The old approach can still be used with
  an additional function parameter.
+ Removed pmsignature from the suggested packages (not allowed in Bioconductor)
+ Reduced the number of tumor genome examples in extdata for faster processing
  and smaller package size (six out of 21 tumors from PMID:22608084)
